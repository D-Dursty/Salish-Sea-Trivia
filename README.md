# Salish-Sea-Trivia
This project was designed to practice implementing our new JavaScript knowledge in the form of a quiz. If you select the correct answer, you will receive a '+1' count, if you choose the wrong answer, 5 seconds will be deducted from the timer. You win the quiz by ending the quiz with the most time on the clock.
